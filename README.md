This repository is WACK dude like I modified stuff on the web GitHub but then modified stuff on the local repository and then the commits weren't synced
and then I accidentally moved files around locally and then reverted my DMSLauncher to a super old version and then committed and pushed that oh god and then I
thought I lost a bunch of stuff because I couldn't find the original but then I found it so I deleted the project from Eclipse and the repository from GitHub and
then recreated them both with the good files phew all good now. That's just if you're curious as to why the initial commit was so recent but tbh you probably didn't even notice.
