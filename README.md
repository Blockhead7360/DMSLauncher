Had a bunch of issues pushing to the old repository from my machine so I made a new one on Jan 31 2021. Much better.

Website: https://blockhead7360.com/dmslauncher

Changelog: https://repo.blockhead7360.com/changelogs/swda-10010

The DMSLauncher was originally created in 2017 but I still occasionally update it for fun (check out the changelog for dates). It's a computer application intended to install a modded Minecraft client for players of all kinds of modded servers and keep the client up to date with any mod changes made by the server owner.
